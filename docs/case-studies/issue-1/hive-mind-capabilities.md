## What is Hive-Mind?

Hive-Mind is an autonomous AI orchestration system ("The orchestrator AI that controls AIs") built on Node.js/JavaScript. It is designed to solve GitHub issues and manage multiple AI workers.

## Core Capabilities

1. **GitHub Issue Resolution**
   - Automatically analyzes and solves GitHub issues
   - Creates pull requests
   - Manages branches and forks
   - Full autonomous mode with sudo access

2. **Multi-Agent Orchestration**
   - Coordinates multiple parallel AI workers
   - Teams of AI agents working simultaneously across repositories
   - Manages concurrent task queues
   - Monitors issues across multiple repositories

3. **Code Review & Automation**
   - Collaborative code review
   - Repository management tasks

## Technology Stack

- **AI Engine**: Claude API (Anthropic)
- **GitHub Integration**: REST and GraphQL APIs
- **Management**: Telegram bot interface for remote control
- **Deployment**: Docker containerization, Kubernetes/Helm support
- **Cost**: ~$200/month Claude MAX subscription
- **Toolchain**: 10+ language runtimes, build tools, theorem provers pre-installed

## Key Properties for Earning Potential

- **License**: Unlicense (public domain) - no restrictions on commercial use
- **Autonomy**: Can work 24/7 without human intervention
- **GitHub-native**: Already integrated with GitHub workflows
- **Multi-language**: Supports 10+ programming languages
- **Quality**: Creates draft PRs for human review (builds trust)

## Task Types Hive-Mind Can Handle

Based on capabilities:
1. Solving coding issues (bugs, features, refactoring)
2. Writing and reviewing code
3. Creating documentation
4. Writing tests
5. Code translation between languages
6. Dependency updates
7. Security vulnerability fixes
8. Configuration and DevOps tasks

## Limitations

1. Cannot handle tasks requiring human identity verification
2. Cannot pass CAPTCHA or biometric checks
3. Cannot attend video interviews
4. Limited by Claude API token costs ($200/month)
5. Quality depends on issue clarity and codebase complexity
