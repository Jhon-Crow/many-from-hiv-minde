| **Algora** | https://algora.io | USD (Stripe) | Low | Perfect | Needs intermediary |
| **IssueHunt** | https://oss.issuehunt.io | Crypto + fiat | Low | Perfect | Crypto option |
| **Opire** | https://opire.dev | Via platform | 4% | Perfect | Needs verification |
| **BountyHub** | https://www.bountyhub.dev | Stripe/PayPal | 10% | Perfect | Needs intermediary |
